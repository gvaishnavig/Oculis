#Oculis ‚Äì AI-Powered OCT Retinal Analysis Platform

Oculis is an AI-driven platform designed to assist in the **early detection and classification of retinal diseases** using **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans**. The system leverages **deep learning models** to automatically classify OCT images into four categories: **Normal, CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization), DME (Diabetic Macular Edema), and Drusen**.

By reducing dependency on manual interpretation, Oculis aims to provide **fast, accessible, and scalable retinal disease diagnosis**, especially for **rural and underserved healthcare settings**.
